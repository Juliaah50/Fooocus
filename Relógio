1. **Image Background:** - Create a surrealistic landscape with distant mountains and a sunset sky with shades of orange, blue and pink. The floor should be desert-like, with soft shadows, in shades of beige and brown. 2. **Melted Clocks:** - Add three melted clocks: - One hanging from a dry tree, which must have a crooked trunk and no leaves. - Another clock must be on top of a solid object (it can be a table or block), with the edges melting. - The third clock must be on the ground, running through the sand. - Clocks must be colored in blue, white, gold, with details of numbers and hands in black. 3. **Central Surrealist Object:** - Include an object in the center, similar to a distorted face or an abstract object, with details of shadows and curves that give a feeling of three-dimensionality and surrealism. 4. **Modern Elements Added:** - Insert modern elements for reinterpretation, such as a smartphone melting next to one of the watches and headphones partially buried in the sand. The smartphone is expected to be black and gray with a color screen that also appears to be melting. 5. **Surrealistic Details and Extras:** - Include details like small butterflies flying near the clocks, a fish floating in the air, and a dry tree with a crow or black bird on one of the branches. - Use contrasting colors like yellow and orange to highlight these elements. 6. **Real Textures:** - Add real textures to the floor, like dry leaves, sawdust or sand, especially where the melted clock meets the floor.
